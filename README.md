A script that allows you to track the trading volume for a selected token, from a certain date to a certain date, for certain wallets in the TON network, and also output information to a Google table for further integration anywhere, the Google table is filled immediately with sorting from a larger value of the trading volume to a smaller one.
All interaction occurs in the terminal, the script can work in real time, updating transactions every minute, thereby creating interactivity, this is useful, for example, for a competition on trading volume, or collecting real-time statistics. But you can also run it once and get information on a selected time series. There is also logging of errors and processes, the logs are stored in a separate file. You can delete wallets, add wallets to the database (sql, initialized and stored on your computer), view information on a specific wallet, specifically all its transactions, trading volume, purchase volume and sales volume, as well as a list of wallets with information on volumes
To run the script you will need: get a google sheets api key in the form of a json file and an api key to tonapi.
